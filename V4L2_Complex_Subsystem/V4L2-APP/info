    If the source YUV buffer is a packed or planar buffer. Packed means that the YUV bits are grouped togheter, planar means the Y, U and V buffers are separated in 3 differents memory area.

    YUV channel size; the single Y,U,V channel could be of 8-bit, 10-bit, 12-bit, etc

    the sampling ratio; A:B:C. 4:2:2 means that you horizontally have 1 Y value for each pixels and one only U and V value shared between two neightboard pixels.



Packed YUV Formats 
HDYC
(UYVY)	0x43594448	16	YUV 4:2:2 (Y sample at every pixel, U and V sampled at every second pixel horizontally on each line). A macropixel contains 2 pixels in 1 u_int32. This is a suplicate of UYVY except that the color components use the BT709 color space (as used in HD video).



Planar YUV Formats:
NV12	0x3231564E	12	8-bit Y plane followed by an interleaved U/V plane with 2x2 subsampling
