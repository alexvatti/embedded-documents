Objective: DDR3 Testing 
========================

step 0:
======

The memory map of UART is mentioned below taken from Tapeout Document [ UART0 is used for Console]
UART-0 	4KB 	0xD457B000 
UART-1 	4KB 	0xD457C000
UART-2 	4KB 	0xD457D000
UART-3  4KB	0xD457E000
UART-4	4KB	0xD457F000

For selecting the UART Port Number
include/shikhara_map.h
#define UART0_BASE		SHIKHARA_UART0_BASE

Step 1:
=========
Memory map of Shikhara Platfrom details: ON Chip RAM details

Name    		Size               Start Address 	End Address
Cortex A9 On-Chip RAM 	64KB 		   0xD45B0000 		0xD45BFFFF

Step 2:
======
***Need to check "arm-none-eabi-gcc" shold be installed and working fine [path has set properly]

 make all  => build
 make clean => to delete the temp files

Step 3: [Information only]
==========================
Code Compilation steps

arm-none-eabi-gcc -nostdlib -mcpu=cortex-a9 -o test.elf -T test.ld main.c startup.s
arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary test.elf test.bin

Step 4: to know th symbols
======
arm-none-eabi-nm -n test.elf

Step 5:
======
Modified Registers with their values for stable working of DDR3

Registers:
ECCCFG0 - 0x00000010
SBRCTL -  0x000FF10

#define ECCCFG0_DATA		0x00000010 /* ECC disable */
#define SBRCTL_DATA		0x0000FF10
