Dear Jean,

Thanks for the inputs & valuable support

Based on the inputs,we have made changes/corrected

1.We are referring and using the code from V0.2 only

(Truly Input: -TFT8001280-12-E application noteV0.2 is right code for module)

2. Corrected the Reset Pin
(Truly Input: About reset pinï¼Œ Please check the use condition  whether satisfied  with IC spec (PAGE 154))
3.  VPP Pin is open now

(Truly Input: Let  VPP pin NC,don't connect  anything.  )

4. We did the BIST Pattern Test Successfully,

By writing to Page 0,Register Address 0xB2h, the value 0x4A( BIST Enable) , we are seeing the color Pattern test on LCD Panel

BIST Pattern(Page Number 141 of HX8260-A_DS_v01_141127.pdf)
When register BIST_EN is trigger to high, then HX8260-A will leave normal operation
mode and starts to generate the BIST pattern to LCD panel without MIPI input signals.


But, We are seeking your inputs , on the Platform side at high level , not at Regisret or bit level

1. we are configuring the LCD Panel Pixel format as RGB24 using set_pixel_format command, this is missing in the initilization sequence
    code: TC358768_DCS_write_1A_1P(0x3A,0x70);

2.we have set_address_mode (0x36h), set_page_address(0x2Bh),set_column_address(0x2Ah), whethe these commands are required to sned to HX8260(LCD)

3.Our MIPI Host contoller can support/operate at 1Gbps/lane(1000Mbps/lane) & getting the clcok 500MHZ, but HX8260 Can operate at  (480Mbps/lane), do we need to change/down grade clock?

4.How much  the byte clock need to be configured? , we are using 125MHZ ( Nothing but 500/8 = 125MHZ)

5.In the initialization code, regardign the lane configuration
   TC358768_DCS_write_1A_1P(0xBB,0xE8); it shows that lanes are configured 1,Please correct me, if I am wrong

6.we have the MIPI Host controller, saying about LCD Parameters, at high level , Please look and suggest if any thing went wrong

                .v_total_lines                  = 1304, 

7. we are usign the video mode with BURST, Whether it can be suppoted by the Panel.

8. Please share the reference platform working code, that will helpful to resolve the issues.



Please consider the open points , that has to be addressed & solved , in order to move forward

    
1.Our MIPI Host contoller can support/operate at 1Gbps/lane(1000Mbps/lane) , but HX8260 Can operate at  (480Mbps/lane) , 

(Action: MIPI Host side we need to down grade )
    Based on the Mbps/lane , we have calculated  lane byte clock  or simply byte clock , Please provide the formula (Seeking info from ASIC Team).  (Action: Based on the calculations , need to reprogram the set of registers on MIPI Host)
    We have calculated the pixel clock , based on the Pixel format, Ex: 24 Bit/Pixel , but now we are moving to  16 Bit/Pixel & 18 Bit/Pixel , Please refer Page Number: 67 in HX8260-A_DS_v01_141127.pdf (Information for you, what are the pixel format our Panel can support) (Action: Based on the calculations , need to reprogram the set of registers on MIPI Host)
    I have no idea about   hsync polarity, vsync polarity ,data en polarity , shutdown polarity ,color mode polarity , Please refer Page Number: 140 in DWC_mipi_dsi_host_databook.pdf( Action: I can look into the reference platform IMX6)
    Need to find the address of Panel to configure the Pixel format( I am looking into HX8260-A_DS_v01_141127.pdf) .(Action: Need to depend on the Reference Platform HX83XX)
